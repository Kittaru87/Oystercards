# Oystercards
Makers week 2: afternoon challenge

## Project aim
To create a program that emulates the oystercard system. The cards must:
* include minimum/maximum balance
* enable top up functionality
* deduct money
* have touch in/touch out support
* charge per journey
* save the current journey (with station name and zone number)
* include a journey log
* calculate the fare per journey
* charge a penalty if certain prerequisites are not met (e.g. never tapped out)

## How to Use
* git clone https://github.com/Kittaru87/Oystercards.git
* cd Oystercards
* install rspec
```
$ gem install rspec
----------
$ rspec --init
```
* This software runs in irb (or Ruby REPL of choice run through the terminal)

### Example run-through
```
>> irb
2.6.3 :001 > require './Oystercard.rb'
 => true 
2.6.3 :002 > oystercard = Oystercard.new
 => #<Oystercard:0x00007fbc670a93f0 @balance=0, @track_history=[]> 
2.6.3 :003 > oystercard.top_up(50)
 => "You have topped up by Â£50" 
2.6.3 :004 > oystercard.touch_in("Peckham Rye")
 => "You have tapped into Peckham Rye" 
2.6.3 :005 > oystercard.in_journey?
 => true 
2.6.3 :006 > oystercard.touch_out("Whitechapel")
 => "You have tapped out of Whitechapel" 
2.6.3 :007 > oystercard.balance
 => 49 
2.6.3 :008 > oystercard.track_history
 => [{"Peckham Rye"=>"Whitechapel"}] 
 2.6.3 :009 > oystercard
 => #<Oystercard:0x00007fbc670a93f0 @balance=49, @track_history=[{"Peckham Rye"=>"Whitechapel"}]> 
 ```
 ## Challenges
 This has been a good exercise for consolidating the skills and lessons learnt from the BorisBike and Airport challenges. The most hardest part of the project so far as been learning about forwarding and polymorphism - splitting up the classes then linking them all back together is so far proving hard.
